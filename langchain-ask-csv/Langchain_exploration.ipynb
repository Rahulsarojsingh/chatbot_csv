      "Human: I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6' so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :).This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa.Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts..Beautiful colors, especially the pink. i am 5'3' and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise, which i don't really mind, but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric..Very slimming, lovely dress.\n",
      "a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe.\n",

      "so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!.I am 5'4' 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron.Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too 'baggy' or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!.I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4', 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha.This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5'..Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Human: I bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it! it's so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details, little metal buttons down the front, the vent pleats on the side; make it feel special. i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort. it was pretty true to size and because i'm an average height i wore a small block heel with it..Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite).Decent quality. i am 5'4' 130 pounds. m is too big. runs slightly large..I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one. it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing, from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt: slip, floral pattern, pleats. i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress. can't recommend it enough. true to size; i'm 5'7' and 133 lb and got a size 4..This dress is really fun and easy to wear all winter. the colors are really easy to pair and like the last reviewer mentioned, i love the sheer sleeves. i was very worried about the comfort of the fabric because most sweater dresses always fail. this dress is extremely comfortable to wear. it is not scratchy at all. it is soft and comfortable for winter even indoors with the building's heat blasting away. the dress will fit the size you normally wear, however it may show lumps and bumps. i would.I wore this dress for christmas and agree that it is beautiful (i received many compliments), while i agree that this sweater dress is beautiful, i'm a little worried about the quality. after just a day of wearing it, it seemed to have lost it's shape. the bottom hem of the dress looked stretched out and it sagged slightly all over. i'm 5'7', 135lbs and my typical size is a m/4 and the dress fit perfectly initially, but not so much by christmas dinner. i'm not giving up on it because i was still.This dress is absolutely beautiful! the grey is more vibrant in real life than the picture suggests and the maroon red is perfect for fall and winter. seriously, this is not your typical sweater dress; the sheer sleeves elevate it to a whole other level. it comes to just above the knee on my 5'7' frame. it is a bit looser on top (i'm 32c) and more form-fitting around the hips but not tight or clingy. and so comfortable! i am 122 lbs and took my usual small so i think it runs true to size. the sl.I tried this on in my regular size and a size up. just didn't work in either. the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough. i did not purchase it..This dress is too short for me to wear as a dress, at 5'7' and over 40. however is is great with leggings and boots.\n",
      "it drapes nicely not over sized like many dresses this style. the color is more earthy than pictured. it's actually nicer in person than online. and it has a wonderful texture to it. i was drawn to it when i walked in the store they had it on display under s short cropped jacket and boots..I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..\u001b[0m\n",

      "Human: The colour is gorgeous but it's basically a baby doll dress - it looks like the waist is much lower on the model but for my height and large chest it' fell like a baby doll or a maternity dress. not flattering. pockets are a nice touch though..I originally bought the white lace version of this dress, but it felt too 'bridey?' then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version. i like that it is not all lace, with the pleated chiffon 'center.' the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow. it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps. well worth the price as this will f.This dress arrived today, and it is both flattering and comfortable. i am just a smidge under 5'4', and i ordered a regular xs. in the front, it hit me about 3' above the knee. it is office appropriate for a business casual environment. the red was deeper in color than i expected (it seemed a little 'brighter' on my monitor), but this is no problem for me; it is still a great color. i tried it with clogs, knee boots and ankle boots - all really cute. and, as and added bonus, it looks good with b.I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model, but unfortunately for me, it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model, but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated, gorgeous dress - just not on me..This was a rare full-price purchase for me. i do think that it runs slightly large, but that is part of the 'look' of this dress. i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist, but they didn't have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s. i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering, but i also think it will transition well with tights, boots, and a cardigan when temps start cooling off..This dress has the same bold, great color as the picture. although it has a big 'swing' to it, because the upper portion is a bit fitted, i don't feel like i look pregnant. the material is extremely well done and i like the above the knee styling. i'm very happy i bought it..This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full, but this one is just too voluminous. also, the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust. this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric. so disappointed, the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too. this can be worn year round, with sandals or boots..The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice. they are a very rich green and pink, which were a popular color combination in the 70's. (i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6', 130 pounds, and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy, the square on the back pulls it in, so it doesn't fit like a tent. perfect for boots now, sandals lat.The second this dress arrived in my store i knew it was a must have. i am all things bohemian and this dress encompasses everything wonderful about a free fitting, feminine bohemian dress! first off the sleeves are not fitted. they have quite a bit of fabric to them (big armed ladies rejoice!), but have an elastic cuff so you can wear them high or low. the only fitted part to this dress is the lace panel (which still fits true to size), and the slip underneath (which appears to have a bit of str.I saw this online, and liked it but then tried it on in a store a few weeks later, and the pictures truly do not do this gem of a dress justice. the fit is flowy but tts as the cotton lining underneath fits closer to the body. it's an incredibly comfortable and easy piece to wear. the first day i wore this i received so many compliments! the colors are vibrant and it's really just a unique piece with beautiful detailing from the embroidery on the top of the dress to the beads on the ties on the\u001b[0m\n",

      "perfect fit and very good quality..This dress is great for work and play. i bought a l and a xl. both fit well, but the sleeves in the large were quite tight. so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose. this dress looks great on. i wish the material was a little higher quality, but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots. the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline..I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!.This dress is adorable. it's easy to wear, really comfortable and i think looks great on. i'm 5'4', i probably should have gotten a petite - the shortest part of the dress meets my knees. the fabric is quite soft, flows like jersey - it does seem to be a little cheaper and i can't speak to durability yet...hoping it holds up!.I was hoping this dress was a bit thicker, but when i tried it on the fabric was very thin and sheer. because of the body skimming design, this dress likely won't work on many without some serious spanx or body trimming hosiery. if you work out and are very fit, you might like it, but i don't so i'm not that brave! lol.Great dress - the hardest part was picking which color. the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering. the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas (lower abdomen and hips). the dress is modest enough for work (it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle, comes to my knee on the sides). i am always a xs or s in maeve - i went with the small on this dress. the sleeves aren't as long as the picture shows - they ended where they should. i went with the navy and w.Love this dress - 'swingy' is definitely the right descriptor. as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger, but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size. it runs slightly large so if you're between sizes i would size down..I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o.This dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer. i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric. also, you can't beat the price for an retailer dress!.The fabric feels and hangs nicely. it's very versatile, you can dress up or down. i purchased the navy stripe one and wear with brown boots. thinking i might need one of the other two as well, perfect for texas winters!!\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful, breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline, upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i.The dress has a partially sewn-in slip, which really didn't work for me. no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn't get the slip and dress to sit properly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i ordered a medium, and if it hadn't been for the slip, the fit would have been good. the length was as pictured. for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40, 34ddd..I wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer, but it just didn't work for me. it made me feel a bit frumpy, honestly. i purchased the neutral color. maybe the 'red' would have been less... grandmotherly. something about the elastic waist just didn't work for me either. i tried this with boots, booties, heels, clogs, flats, sandals and i just couldn't make this dress work. sadly sending this one back. i'm 5'7', 140 lbs and tried the medium..The model in this photo should be standing tall, because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper! i ordered a small, and am 130pounds 5'5'- the dress fits like a glove, and is a pull over style. the nude slip- lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel, yet nice breezy, sexy appeal. this dress can be worn to work, on a hot date, and even a nice weekend look. when i say slimming i mean it. the center detail- grabs the most perf.I bought this in the neutral motif and my expectations before trying it on weren't high but i was sold once i was in the dress. sometimes dresses that have the elastic band in the waist can be tricky if you don't have a perfectly flat tummy and can accentuate the tiniest bump. however, this dress sits perfectly on the waist and is actually super slimming. i wasn't 100% sold on the pattern or color (i wish it was more off white than brown) but the fit was so great that i had to buy it! the dress.I am short (5'3') and very curvy. i usually get petite in dresses. something about this fit was strange. it was definitely a little shorter than most petites. the lace detail on the front of this dress is really cute and it is a color you don't see often so i kept it..This dress is amazing. bought in orange and fits wonderfully. great quality and could transition in between seasons.Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer..I love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me. i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on. i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between, and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large. really it just depends on how you want it to fit. the length is great too, about 3 inches above my knee, i'm 5 foot 5, which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit. i got the.Purchased this in the burnt orange color - very nice!\r\n",

      "Human: I tried this dress on in the store in the mango color but opted to order the blue. the dress is beautifully made and the fit is fantastic..I bought this dress in store today in a size 4, i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress, there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading..I'm a 36ddd, and have a bust about 42' so when i tried this on in a size 12, i honestly didn't expect to be able to squeeze it on... and yet i had inches upon inches to spare in the bust. this really is built more like a tent than a dress. on the bright side though, if you belt it, and gather the extra material at the sides it'll define your waist and the skirt has lots of swing and flounce to it. i do love a line styles!! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i found i had to roll up the sleeves otherwise the dress looked too s.Totally out of my style range but am totally enamored by this tent dress/shirt/coat thing! ok, so yes it's very very tenty, but fits on my shoulders (size down 1x or 2x if you're narrow shouldered) and i use one of my leather belts to gather the material and make myself a nice western fit & flare! like the model shots, this looks great with a tee and skinnies. if you have tried the marvelous silk santee swing dress, the escalante has the same amount of fabric that reviewer either love or hate. i.It's relatively light material; even if you layered a sweater over this i can't see it being good for winter. i'm in california so it's fine :) length is great - i'm 5'4 and it hits just at the knee. i'm a true size 2/small and this fit great, even though i have a curvier figure. pretty classic dress..It's not often you can find a dress that is warm, cozy, timeless, and sexy at the same time, but this one is it. the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places. i normally wear an xs or s, and in this i took an xs. sleeves are nice and long. your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be, depending on how low you fold over the collar piece. i chose to tack mine down in place, so i'm not always adjusting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "i wore this dress with black heeled over-the-knee boots.This initially caught my eye online and then i immediately tried it on when our store received it. the dress is simple and well structured with a tight sweater weave that almost has a' hold u in' feel. therefore, it fits like a glove on!!.Love the dress. i usually wear a small and will be exchanging it for an x-small..Lovely body hugging dress. hits just below the knee. great with boots as shown, or with heels. very soft material and the peppery color is really pretty. i can see myself wearing this to work and out at night. this is a winner!.I went back and bought this dress after a sales associate told me that it was super cute on but didn't look like much on the hanger. i'm 5'3' and curvy and the s fit great. it will look great with boots or booties. it's very comfortable and nice quality material.\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: Soft, comfy, great fit. this is the perfect cozy item for fall and winter. looks really cute with the sleeves rolled or cuffed slightly. the fabric is patchworked with linen and a terry/jersey material. i'm usually a medium and the medium fit great. slimming lines and does a great job of being swingy/flared, without that tent look..This is such a fun dress. the linen and cotton mixture is very unique and comfortable. for reference, i am 5'3' and about 110 pounds. the regular xs hits me exactly the way it is shown in the photo. the color is a true oatmeal which is so nice for fall and even though i am fair with strawberry blonde hair, it doesn't wash me out. the sleeves are a little long but i rolled them once and it is perfect. i love this dress and it will look great with booties or boots for the fall..I love this dress.   i believe the picture on-line doesn't show the unique pattern and design.   it does have an interesting design.    add a long vest, statement necklace, and boots - you will be quite fashionable..I really want to love this dress, the style and colors are so nice and easy. i like the loose flowy feel of the dress. it runs a tad large, but that is part of the style. what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy, to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress. also, it has lining which is nice for modesty, but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining, it feels a bit cumbersome. i haven't decided if i will k.When i received this dress i was surprised by the weight of the fabric. it's not as light and gauzy as the photos appear, and it is fully lined. it's more substantial in a good way. also i had thought it would be more of a straight cut but it's definitely a swing which i prefer. with the lining, it does stand out a bit from your body so it's not a clingy look at all. i like it a lot but i don't think it fits the way you would expect from the photo. it's roomy, i could probably have sized down. i.I found this dress to be a perfect flowy fit for the super-hot tail end of summer. this definitely is not a form fitting dress, but i bought my regular size medium (size 6) and think it fits perfectly. i have a pretty small chest and find that sometimes these a-line dresses look better if you don't have a lot on top making them 'tent out'. just my opinion. personally do not think it has an abundance of fabric. in fact, it is a lot less roomy than a lot of others in this cut due to the embroidery.The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style isn't for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it didn't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress..Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it's for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric, but not intolerable. i love this dress but it's beyond a-line, it's a tent. i'm keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that's seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy, thick shoulders/back/upper arms), i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if.As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size..I just received this dress tried it on. i totally fell in love with it . the pink is just beautiful.it's a little big so i will definitely will be exchanging it for a size 14 . you would absolutely love this dress.\u001b[0m\n"

(i'm an xl usually, and the fit was tts) the only thing i'm not crazy about is the slip, it's more of a flesh toned color. i'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these, retailer!.First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model, where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was, i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7'.After seeing an influx of this dress in my instagram feed i decided to go ahead and purchase it last weekend. i'm usually leery with the length of swing dresses, for instance the endora swing dress (paper crown) is a touch too short for my taste in petite sizing. either way, i decided to go ahead and purchase this dress in petite considering no previous reviews mentioned the length of the dress to be an issue. \r\n",

      "Human: I just bought this pretty dress at my local retailer after finally deciding to go in the store to try it on. once i saw it on display in the window in the lilac, i already knew i was going to try that one on and take it home though i really love both colors and prints. the dress fit me tts (sz 6, 34d-27-35) and looks absolutely adorable on! it's super soft, light weight but not so much that you don't feel it's worth the price and the design reminds me of the retailer i love. it has a wonderful vinta.After seeing this dress online i wanted to try it on and was not disappointed when i did. even though the coral color dress of the same style was pretty it wasn't the right color for me. i absolutely love the blue and white dress! i usually wear a size 8 but found the 6 was more flattering. i'm 5'2' and the length was perfect - above the knee but not too high. love it!.This dress is adorable! it fits loose and is not at all fitted, with the exception of the under cami lining. the picture showing front and back is being pulled to fit. :/ it fits like the model wearing the purple. my local store was out of my normal size so i sized up which really made no difference at all. the biggest difference would be the under cami. the dress is flowy and airy. one of the best casual dresses retailer has had in a long time. obviously, the blue is sold out till may. this can b.Sometimes i feel like i have to try on the dresses that sell out super fast, just out of curiosity. and sometimes, they're surprise hits, like this one. i tried on the purple/black/blue option, and i had to have it. it is boxy through the torso, but the length keeps it from being too cutesy--it's pretty short. i'm just 5'5', and i'm not sure this is work appropriate without tights. i may have to try, though, as otherwise it's a great workable dress for summer--not too tight or revealing in the b.This dress makes you feel like a little kid. it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress, for sure. i wish it had a little more definition to the waist--it just barely works for larger chested women, definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless. the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that it's hard to pass this one up. it's just too beautiful. i recommend it, but it's probably not for everyone..I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress..I wanted to wear this for my journey to cuncun and i wanted the blight pink as photo however it was a dark pink which didn't fit to me unfortunately... but the design was pretty!.Just not the right color for my skin tone (though lovely pink). i didn't see the green in person, but probably nice too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the cut is well fitted at the waist, elastic band. i will say, however, that it was almost hard to pull the shoulders over (doesn't unbutton past waist). fabric is soft and flowey, length on the regular was mid-though for me, i am a tad oder, so it was nice... if i were younger, i would get petite.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "for reference: 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 inch waist.This romper is cute. i won't deny that. however, the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas. i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly. however, the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders. i'm short, but have a little wider shoulders, so, perhaps that was the issue. it seems like another reviewer had the same problem. there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down, so, i had to do some cont.So, this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made, flowey. very comfortable, until you have to take it off.\r\n",
      "this is the review i posted on facebook. \r\n",
      "so, no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror, or maybe has not shared with me, that moment when you cannot get out of, because it has turned into a straight jacket, that otherwise cute romper. and again, maybe a man invented it!\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: A fun, casual romper. i loved the pink color (not usually my thing), which looks great with darker skin. like another reviewer said, the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes (i took a size 6 in this, but am usually a 2/4) - this will make the top part a bit blousy, but i think that adds to the appeal/ look..This romper is fabulous! i bought it in lime, and the color is great and perfect for summer. i do agree with the other reviewers that it's hard to get in and out of the sleeves (hence giving it only 4 starts for quality#, but the struggle is worth it. the fabric is lightweight and silky, so it feels cool and soft; it feels like wearing pjs. it's also very flattering with the bow just at the waist; it hides a not-so-flat tummy. i'm 5'4', between 135 and 140, and curvy #very busty specifically), a.As with other maeve dresses, the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online, i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however, only the smallest size had the great snake on the back.I disagree with the other reviews...the colors on this dress are great. bright against the black and the studs are super cute. and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch. fun dress. i think it's as fitted or not as you want. drives me crazy when people get hung up on their 'size' to judge clothes. go up or down if it doesn't fit the way you want. i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly..The snake and the studs, they make the dress. sadly, the snake is hard to find, as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large, i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small, fitted look, and the other two show a full, swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go..I love this dress! it's very cute and comfortable. i belted it to give me more of a waistline because otherwise the tented shape overwhelms my short stature. i love the strap design at the neckline. the off the shoulder sleeves are comfortable. i have an xsp which is true to size for me..I love the way this dress looks on me. it skims my figure to hide my flaws, the bright embroidery is eye catching, the layers flow when i walk, it's a great midi length and it doesn't make me look wider in profile.  i'm not having the see-through issue since the patterns are busy and my lingerie matches.  i purchased 10 petite and my measurements are 39-28-35. \r\n",

      "Human: I tried the other dresses by this brand and they were short and didn't fit well. but this dress fit better,i bought the orange size 8 and it fit good with a swing to the bottom. for reference i am 5''9 , 34dd and thin and this fit well with some room. this time they got the slip right and its not tight and the length hits right above the knee which give an overall better look plus the long sleeve balances out the dress. i'm going to wear mine with tall brown boots..I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line..This dress is beautiful. however, it should be noted that there is a gold threading detail throughout the dress, which is not pictured. the dress appears to be a solid cream print in the pics but in person it has gold and cream. i sized up bc i didn't want it to be too fitted, i'm between a 6 snd 8 so i went w medium. it fits will but slightly big. i'd say tts though..The fit and style of this dress are beautiful. it's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable. i really wanted to love it, but the color just didn't work for me. the pictures make it look like it's a nice cream color, but it's very tan and i can't pull it off with my coloring..This fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's lightweight and stretchy. the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made. i had to try on 5 different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress. hence 4 stars. the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not. it is not see through. i'm 5'4' and 120#..I also agree with the other reviewers that it's important to try on a couple due to pattern differences. this dress has a beige base- the photo is a little misleading. i ended up returning it because the colors didn't do much for me, i think they look great on the model but that's because the beige doesn't blend into her at all. i also think it's a little overpriced for what the dress is- a great summer day dress..I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1' and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as 'runs large' because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo.Flowy, comfy plaid dress perfect for the fall or winter. front is much shorter than the back - at 5'8' the front is nearly too short on me, but works with a pair of tights. dress has a cami slip underneath, which is needed as the blue detailing across the chest and down the center is sheer, adding to how special the dress is. can be made more or less casual based on accessories and footwear!.Wore this dress for easter dinner and received many compliments. it is delicate and if not careful the diamond pattern can snag. i loved the comfort and ability to dress up or down. i ordered the regular instead of petite as i wanted the length at my knees not thigh high. and it fit perfect at 5'4..This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape, but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..\u001b[0m\n"

      "i tried on both 0p and 00p - not much difference in the 2 (i would go petite if you are on the short side). the 00p was just a bit snugger near the =chest, but didn't gape. the waist is definitely meant to be looser, so don't expect a fitted dress. length was slightly above the knee.Oh my! this dress fits wonderfully on! so ready for autumn! i have a big bust, this dress does not split at the buttons..I tried this on in the store, in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one, i could go either way.\n",

      "the cut is flattering fit and flare, and the colors are rich. i like the 'flowery' design, good spring piece in my opinion, as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material, buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy, very soft. not too flimsy iether..The dress is very cute, probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee, which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin, but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely..The print and detail on this dress are so much better in person, especially the neckline! i agree with the previous reviewer in that it felt spring-timey to me. flattering fit and flare however the top runs extremely small. i am usually a 6 in retailer dresses and i could barely zip the 8 over my bust but the 10 was enormous. rest of the dress fit fine but if you are large up top you might want to size up. fabric does not stretch. overall too cute to pass up! for reference i am a 34dd..This dress is great. wear now and into fall with boots and leggings. it seems to have structure with the seams and is nicley flowy..Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress..Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. \r\n",
      "why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo..I tried the regular szie in store, like the cut, need petite though (too long and a lot of fabric) - i am 5'1.5' and 115lbs... color, unfortunatly, looke aweful on my skin tone and washed me out. would need to be more red, the striping washed out the color nad dind't look flattering on me. the cut did, however.\r\n",

      "Human: I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue. i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it. when i tried it on, i went a complete size down. i'm usually an 8, but i snagged this beauty in a 6. the top part really does run larger, so unless you have really broad shoulders, you'll need to size down. the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place, and the little tie in the front is awesome, because not only is it an interesting detail, it can be loosened or tightened d.Ok...so after reading the other reviews, i'm sad to say i rated this as 'runs small' only because i usually buy one or two sizes smaller in maeve than i settled on with this dress. it's actually an adorable dress but i'm sure you have to have the right figure. i don't think any one woman has the same figure as another and this dress is made for someone with a very definite hourglass figure. i have a large chest, a moderate middle and large hips. i really loved both sizes but i chose to size up b.Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back..I tried this dress on in the store, prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer, it would look more proportionate. next, the tie is really difficult to place, but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily, i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined, what a bummer, at least the skirt could be lined. but, it does have pockets, that is sweet..I love the dress overall, however, found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall, a beautiful dress to own..I love this dress. it is exactly my style, which is probably why i love it: girly, frilly, flowy... i love how much material it has. it flows and twirls in such a nice way because of the amount of fabric. it's the right length that the amount of material is not overwhelming - i'm 5'5' and it hits just above my knees. i am currently 6 months pregnant, and it's plenty roomy to fit now, and will also mask the post-baby belly this summer. the only 2 cons, and the other reviewers touched on these as.Very charming, well made and comfortable. it is a heavier material with a slip so it's a great spring dress if you have cooler days but i could see in the summer if you have 80f + temps it could be a little warm. i have a 34c/d chest and i didn't find it too snug like the other reviewer. pretty tts for maeve..This is really flattering. it's one of the best purchases i've made through retailer. i know it will work with a lot of different body types. the medium fit me well. i bought a petite version by mistake but it still fits..This is one of those rare garments that is actually as flattering on me as it looks on the model. just like the picture, it hangs like a dress and emphasizes my curves without seeming too revealing. the weight of the fabric creates graceful movement, while the loose cut keeps it cool and breezy. for reference, i am 5'4' and curvy (34d, 35x28x39), and i ordered a small petite. this is a smaller size than i would wear in most styles, but it fits almost like it was made for me. the tie hits slightl.This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: I love this piece! they're calling it a tunic but its plenty long enough to wear without any pants. i usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer sizes and i definitely went with the xsmall. size down to avoid the potato sack look. i think this piece is so great for fall. definitely a must buy!.The large is perfect for me and is just my style - not too baggy but just shapely enough to where to the office with or without leggings, as the fall approaches. i bought the blue; the color is rich and saturated. the material is soft and all around comfortable, which is my number one factor in buying clothes. love its versatility too, since a jacket and scarf can dress it up. shoes also dress up or dress down the dress. all in all a bargain..I've been hesitant with crushed velvet comeback...but this dress is adorable! first, it is not a tent; on me it's the perfect fit for the style - not too swingy but definitely not fitted. this is the dress you can grab on a day you don't feel like sucking it in, throw a blazer over it if you need you look professional, wear to a girls brunch with booties or a night out with the hubs. the little extra detail i didn't see online that was a pleasant style surprise is the almost strap-looking piece.Love love love this dress! i was worried the velvet would look cheap, but it absolutely does not! i bought an xxsmall and it is a little tight in the chest, but everything else fits perfectly ! i bought this in the slate color, but am seriously considering buying the lighter color as well!.Saw this at the store and it is breathtaking in person. as the previous reviewer stated, i too consider this a dress and not a tunic, and it's not really crinkled either. the dress is structured, very soft, and so gorgeous on. i tried on a regular x-small and it fit but a bit uncomfortable at the mid section. the small fit better (it's meant to be a bit loose, bohemian looking) and the hem falls right at my knees which is perfect for the office (i'm 5'2', 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i have medium o.Saw this in store and could hardly wait to try it on! the print is adorable and colors are vibrant. the material is heavier than i'd like for hot phoenix summers but decided to get it anyway. will be great for work. i noticed that there is a little more room in the chest area of this dress but not a deal breaker. seems to be well made in general and i love the pockets!.This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts, very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me.This dress is my first retailer purchase in several years. i saw it in the window and had to try it on! i'm quite small, usually a size 0, 2 at most, and 34b at the top. i had to size up to a 4 in this dress for it to zip up and be moderately comfortable.\r\n",

      "i love the 50s vibe of the volume at the bottom. the cotton is nice - glad to see retailer go back to offering natural fabrics!\r\n",

      "very pretty color, and print..It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. i have several maeve dresses which i love so i thought this would be a sure thing. i was really excited when it arrived because when i opened the package the dress looked just as beautiful...until i put it on. fit is fine from the waist down but the upper part fits very poorly especially in the back.\n",
      "not sure if it's the zipper that pulls the fabric or if there's just too much fabric in the back but the back of the bodice doesn't lie flat.This dress has a very flattering cut and the style is very cute. i ordered a 4 petite and i typically wear a 2 or 4 regularly. the 4 petite was a great length (above the knee but not inappropriate). i wore to a bridal shower and received a lot of compliments!\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color, but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress, the cheap, horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up, right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap..I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric. it's light, soft and crisp, which is perfect for summer days. the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso. the waste line is a bit high for me, but overall it didn't feel weird or look funny. there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with. once i tried it on, i had to bring it home with me!.I love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one (for my taste). 1) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs, 2) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down, even when it's just on the hanger. 3) the bow is really cute but doesn't make up for the other shortcomings..I normally don't write reviews for clothing but this dress warrants an exception.\r\n",

      "i am a little over six months pregnant and have a shotgun wedding at city hall in a couple of weeks. with a limited amount of time to plan, i bought a bunch of pregnant wedding dresses online and rented the runway, to arrive just before the actual ceremony. out of curiosity, i walked into retailer today to see if they had any white or ivory dresses that would look cute and city hall wedding-ish. they did! so i too.5'5', 130, 32dd. i saw this dress online and thought it was beautiful, but considered not buying it because of other comments that the bust was too small for women with more curves. fortunately, the lovely blue dress was in my local retailer store and i decided to try it on in a size 4. i think the dress fits perfectly and i have gotten many compliments, including from random strangers. i have had no problem with a tight zipper or a low back, which is perfectly able to cover my bra in the back. th.The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6' 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok, but i felt more comfortable in the 6, and it had a really nice fit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the quality is good, but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges, so i'm not sure how it will wear..I specifically bought this dress for my bridal shower and loved it! i'm small on top and have hips that don't lie. i purchased the size 2 petite. the waist portion of the dress came up a little higher which was ok since it fell at a small part of my waist. the length was just above my knee, which i prefer. the dress has a nude lining which compliments my tan skin tone. i wore a regular nude bra that didn't show beneath the liner. i received many compliments and would highly recommend it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the.This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture, the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture, even though the rest fit perfectly..I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer, and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think, 120-lb marathoner), and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th.I bough this dress in blue and i cannot tell you the compliments and the looks i get on the street! no kidding! this is a beautiful dress which has a very feminine/romantic quality to it. i bought size 4 and it sits perfectly on my waist i completely fell in love with that dress and especially with the lace work and the design. this is a classic piece, that is always going to be timeless in my opinion. no regret at all to have bought it!\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: I knew the ivory color was online only so i tried the blue one for size and i couldn't believe how nice the blue one is. i ended up buying it. i purchased a size bigger because mine wasn't available but because of lace and side zip, it still doesn't look huge. if i find my size in another store i can always exchange, but i couldn't leave the dress behind..Love this dress. the fringe makes it so special! it's a little shorter than i anticpated - it hits me right about where it shows on the model and i am 5 2'. i love the length. can't wait to wear this..Just received this dress and i am in love! the colors are beautiful- perfect for both summer and fall. the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch. i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer. it was completely sold out in my size 0. however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color (and now lined yay!) i had to buy it. would defin recommend!!.The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul.This is a beautiful dress! i love the patterns, the beading and the texture. however, i have returned it (size medium - my usual size) and asked for an exchange up to a large (fingers crossed it will be available!) because the shoulders are very narrow. i am fairly tall (5'8') with an athletic build. the body fit was a bit tighter than i expected also but not really an issue. however, the shoulders were obviously tight making it look too small and uncomfortable. yikes! i sooooo love this dress a.Sweater dresses are my fall/winter uniform and the patterns on this one are particularly unique and lovely. i'm 5'2'' with a small bust, this fit nicely and moves well, it's not baggy or bulky and not tight. good for work and play. i would usually wait to see if an item at this price goes on sale, but this one is the kind of piece that i expect to be snapped up swiftly and i don't regret getting it at full price..Beautiful sweater dress. nice texture gorgeous pattern. however not for my body type! i'm 5'5', a size 12-14 and i carry my weight in hips butt & tummy area. this dress is only slightly a line, almost straight and even the xl didn't look flattering on me. and the arms are definitely smaller and weird too-there is bunching in the pit area. i tried on a large for comparison and it was too tight all over and there was a button missing too. this def. runs small and i think will be flattering on the.Tried this dress in two different sizes and just couldn't get a god fit for me. i found the upper arms a little snug and unforgiving if you don't have slim arms. it is a beautiful dress in person, probably more so than in the photos, and a nice thick quality feel. it didn't work on my frame, but i definitely recommend you give it a try..This dress is so pretty and the fabric is tightly woven so that it won't stretch as much as other sweater dresses. i am disappointed in the sleeves though. the cut is way below the armpit so that when you raise your arms, it pulls tight and is uncomfortable. for the price, and the amount of time i wanted to wear it, it's not worth keeping. another thing is that the fabric is tightly woven so if you are cold natured and ok with the sleeve issue, this is the dress for you. however, if you are hot.Unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless.\u001b[0m\n"

      "for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 and 34dd. i got the medium and it fits great! only flaw is that the armholes are a little large, but not enough that my bra shows so i am okay with it..I wanted this dress in the turquoise motif, but it sold out so quickly! i tried on about 10 dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner. i got the blue and white motif, which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress. i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable. you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over, or the skirt flying up in the breeze, or needing a strapless bra. the skirt flows really nicely and over.This dress looks way better on you than sitting on the hanger! the design really flatters your body and the waist area, makes you look very skinny! highly recommend! the length is also perfect, just the right length for a maxi dress, long enough but short enough to show off your shoes as well!.I just scored this dress the other day and i don't regret it for a second. the bodice is beaded with some sea-foam green beads and they are sewn on really well, so i am not worried about dropping them all night. from the pictures, i couldn't tell if this was going to look like a cotton skirt or i fit would be chiffon looking-it is neither. it has a shimmer to it which makes this a more dressy looking dress than i was originally anticipating-i thought it was going to be an everyday wear type of d.I saw this dress in the store tried it on and , love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14), plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: I love the colors of the teal dress, but i wish that the top only had one color. the design is cute but the construction is a little off. the transition from the top to the skirt seems to lay wrong or have a bit of extra fabric. sizing up or down didn't help. the top is lined but the bottom is very thin. the bottom should be lined too. not the best..I love this maxi dress. it is fitted up top and very maxi like on the bottom. it was to much fabric for me, the dress made me look heavier than i am. i am 5'9' and 160. i fit in the medium. the dress just didn't do anything for my body type - curvy. i think you need to be fairly lean to look nice in this dress. sadly, i had to return. maeve makes great maxi's, unfortunately they don't fit me correctly..This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!.I bought this to wear for my baby shower at 34 weeks. i was able to buy it in my size and still get a great fit, and the skirt hits right at my bump with the band just above it. great option for expecting mothers that can be worn after baby, the top is also snug enough to feel like it covers properly (could be too snug if you are large chested though)..The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40, 34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort, but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long, so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size..I'm 4 11' 120 and my usual small fit. as with everything....way too long. story of my life and i keel a tailor on call..I bought each color in three different sizes because the one i want was sold out. the lavender tile motif is the one i got in my ideal size medium petite and it fits the best. what i don't like is that the inside of the skirt is white, which features prominently because of the high side slits. makes the dress look low quality. my favorite dresses were the solid teal and solid black. however the small was too small on my bust and the large petite was too large on my bust. i'm wondering if wash th.I purchased this in the black in an xl. i am typically a 14-16 dress size and i would say this runs tts with a flowing fit on the bottom. the top is fitted but has some stretch to it. absolutely gorgeous fit and quality. i love this so much i want to purchase the teal color. a spring must have!!!.This dress has the perfect amount of swing to it that it hides a stomach - which i looooove! the blue chambray color is beautiful and it is lined partially. so here's what i don't like - this dress would have been so much better fully lined. now it could just be that i am extra sensitive to fabric and find it to be a bit itchy where the ruching is on the upper back of the dress. but i somehow can't get myself to take it off the hanger to wear it....i may just be returning this dress..I tried this on in store in blue, and it's so comfortable. it's just the right level of loose to be flattering. for me, the cap sleeves were a little strange. they just didn't sit in a way that was flattering or seemed purposeful--not sure if that was the design or my body.\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: I just bought this dress today, and it is absolutely stunning. it looks so much better in person than on the model. i think it runs true to size, however it does have relaxed fit. overall, the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow, without adding bulk. great buy!.I adore this dress! as a mom of two under 2, i need things that are cute, but no-fuss. this is exactly that piece! beautifully lined, breezy linen fabric, machine-washable, and flattering. the catch is finding the right size to flatter. i'm 5'7 and 128...found my normal size small to be really big everywhere. i went with the xs to avoid issues in the shoulders, but i maybe could have gone even smaller. fabric doesn't have a lot of give, so if you are large in the chest, my guess would be a possi.I am a size  14, and tall.  i was afraid that it would be too short.  the sales clerk grabbed a large,  and it fit! it's airy and lightweight and hugs nicely around the back.  the big surprise?  pockets! love it!.Caught my eye at checkout, and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick try-on, which ended up being a great call! the dress is super easy and flattering, as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape. the fabric has a sweet floral texture, and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting. i'm 5'4' and it came just above the knee in front, while the back was a bit longer (another flattering feature). this is going to be a summer go-to!.I love love love this dress for everyday running around or you can dress it up with jewelry or a scarf. so boho and so comfortable. buying the other color now..Easy breezy summer dress!!! love the detailing under the arms!!!.I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i'm only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26' waist, 34' hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it's the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it's attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn't flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b.I really like the soft, flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 5'5'' 125lbs, the s was too large, so i ordered the xs instead. things to note: pockets, elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides, slip underneath, and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing..I love the colors and pattern on this dress, and it's nice that it has a lining so no slip needed.  the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however, i'm pretty small up top, and the neckline comes pretty low, so i either have to wear my craziest push-up bra, or get the top altered. i haven't decided what my plan is yet, but will keep the dress for sure..5'6 149lbs 34d normally size 6\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif\u001b[0m\n"

      "Human: I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6' so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :).This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa.Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts..Beautiful colors, especially the pink. i am 5'3' and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise, which i don't really mind, but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric..Very slimming, lovely dress.\n",

      "so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!.I am 5'4' 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron.Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too 'baggy' or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!.I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4', 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha.This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5'..Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.\u001b[0m\n",

(i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6', 130 pounds, and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy, the square on the back pulls it in, so it doesn't fit like a tent. perfect for boots now, sandals lat.I saw this online, and liked it but then tried it on in a store a few weeks later, and the pictures truly do not do this gem of a dress justice. the fit is flowy but tts as the cotton lining underneath fits closer to the body. it's an incredibly comfortable and easy piece to wear. the first day i wore this i received so many compliments! the colors are vibrant and it's really just a unique piece with beautiful detailing from the embroidery on the top of the dress to the beads on the ties on the.I love this dress .\\r\\nperfect fit and very good quality..This dress is great for work and play. i bought a l and a xl. both fit well, but the sleeves in the large were quite tight. so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose. this dress looks great on. i wish the material was a little higher quality, but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots. the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline..I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!.This dress is adorable. it's easy to wear, really comfortable and i think looks great on. i'm 5'4', i probably should have gotten a petite - the shortest part of the dress meets my knees. the fabric is quite soft, flows like jersey - it does seem to be a little cheaper and i can't speak to durability yet...hoping it holds up!.Love this dress - 'swingy' is definitely the right descriptor. as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger, but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size. it runs slightly large so if you're between sizes i would size down..I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o.This dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer. i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric. also, you can't beat the price for an retailer dress!.The fabric feels and hangs nicely. it's very versatile, you can dress up or down. i purchased the navy stripe one and wear with brown boots. thinking i might need one of the other two as well, perfect for texas winters!!.Love this dress! i can't say enough about it. comfortable, stylish, packable! doesn't wrinkle at all. i love it. i bought the neutral and the turquoise. only planned on keeping one but i love it so much i'm keeping both. good dress for fall/winter to wear with flats or tights and boots. can easily be dressed up or worn casual. i am 5'1' 115 lbs and bought the xs petite. perfect fit. a great price point especially with the 25% off dresses..I am 5'1', 32-26-36 and 115 lbs and got the xsp in the neutral motif at a great price. shipping was quick as well (2 business days). the dotted swirly lines are more beige than they appear on the model. great shape and easy jersey silhouette that will be flattering on all body shapes! will look great with a long statement necklace..I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable, it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9', 145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it..I purchased a medium. i am 5'6' 140 lbs and it fit perfectly. the navy is pretty dark, almost black. the fabric is very soft. the cut is more form fitting in the top and then comes out to an a line. it is not as bulky as some swing dresses. in the photo it almost looks like a handkerchief hem, but in real life it is less pronounced. i have no negatives. i would consider getting a second pattern if it goes on sale.\""

      "so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!.I am 5'4' 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron.Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too 'baggy' or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!.I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4', 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha.This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5'..Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.\u001b[0m\n",

Some customers found it to be too short, while others felt it was the perfect length. The fit and flare style was praised for being flattering and slimming. The embroidery on the dress was also appreciated for adding character. The fabric was described as soft and comfortable, but some customers mentioned that it is thin and shows lumps and bumps. Overall, the dress seems to be a popular choice for spring and fall events, but potential buyers should be aware of the length and fabric thickness.'"
